So till now, what we've done is we have calculated the error
for the performance on the train data and we have generated
the graph for the performance on the test data.
So let us also generate a graph.
What a performance on the train data.
So your code should look like this hist a gram perf
underscore instead of test and and train and everything else
remains the same.
Just change this to train and hit run here too.
We have a bell curve shape so the distribution is normal.
Now let's conduct cross validation on our multiple linear
regression model.
Since we already defined the function previously, we could
just use the same function but fitted with the new model.
So type in cross underscore relegation from the bracket.
We use the train data comma Real specify 10 folds.
Once again, Hama and the new formula that is FM one which
is used for our multiple linear regression model hit Run Once
again, you should get 10 different values.
Let's check the variants on these values.
So we have 0.3 point 1.2.
The variation is once again, not much With this.
We have come to the end off this guided project.
Congratulations on completing discarded project.
I hope that you learned a lot about linear regression and how
to use Julia to do a linear regression.
Remember to keep practicing so that you can improve your
skills in Julia programming.
