Build a linear regression model.
We're going to use the G L M package or the Generalized
Linear Model package began by typing it using G l M it center
and in the new line we're going to define our formula.
The type in F M is equal to at formula Open a bracket hoping
game Build a rose.
Then in the new line, we're going to use the L M functions
first type in Lynn Rag.
That's what we're going to name A model is equal to Lim is
the function that will build the model for us And this is
where we specify the formula and the data set to be used.
We're going to work with the train Bartoszek, then hit Run.
You should get an output similar to mine where you get the
coefficient, the standard error, the lower 95% which is the
lower court style and the upper 95% which is the upper
quartile.
We check if our model will give us the best results were
going to calculate wth e r square value.
This value is a statistical measure which tells us the
proportion off variation in the dependent variable that is
explained by the independent variable in the model.
Basically, the higher the R squared value, the better on the
maximum value that you can get for the R squared.
Value is one.
Lucky for us, Julia has a built in function to calculate the
R squared value.
Suggest happen are two open bracket and enter the name off
our model, which is Lynn Rag that run mhm.
We get point triple 97 et cetera, which, when rounded off,
comes upto one, which means our model is good.
The model is ready.
So Lex, again getting predictions, we'll generate the
variable test.
Underscore pred.
This will be for the test data predict in the bracket Flynn
Greg Common Test.
After that hit, run and in a new line, type in train on the
score. Paret and say, That's equal Coop.
Predict open a bracket Lynn Rig Comma queen.
Add a semi colon at the end of the line to prevent it from
printing out any values.
Let's add a semi colon appearance well and hit run.
