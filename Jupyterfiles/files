linear.jl and linear regression.jl both are same
linear.ipynb and linear regression.ipynb both are same
(files names are linear but contains both linear and multiple regression)
just download and upload the Linear regression.ipynb file in your jupyter lab with the dataset file, and you are good to go. :)
